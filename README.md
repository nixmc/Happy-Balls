## Overview

Our aim is to measure and raise awareness of the happiness of attendees of the 
[Brighton Maker Faire](http://www.makerfairebrighton.com/) throughout the day 
of the event (Saturday 3rd September, 2011).

We will be collecting data from attendees via small outposts dotted around the 
venue. Each outpost will ask the question "How are you feeling?", respondents can 
answer by hitting one of 2 buttons; a positive "Smiley" button and a negative 
"Sad" button.

Responses will be transmitted wirelessly to a central location where the 
happiness levels of the entire event will be analysed and displayed in
real-time for all to see.
